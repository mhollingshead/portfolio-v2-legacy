            <p>When I was 12 years old I accidentally discovered HTML. I started messing around with my first HTML element, <input type="radio" aria-label='<input type="radio" />' data-microtip-position="top-left" role="tooltip" />, and soon after wrote my <a href="https://makecheckboxart.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">first website ever</a> <i>(I promise I've improved)</i>. Since then I was hooked.</p>
            <p>I attended McGill University for Software Engineering, learning the ins and outs of Object Oriented programming, data structures / algorithm theory &amp; design principlesâ€“ spending my free time as a freelance web developer and graphic designer while cranking out countless <a href="#projects">personal projects</a>... learning about anything development-related I could get my hands on. Graduating from BrainStation's intensive Web Development Bootcamp cemented the fact that development is what I'm truly passionate about.</p>
